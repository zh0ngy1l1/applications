    <h1>Why do you want to study this course or subject?</h1>
    <p>Since receiving the top prize at the Finnish national mathematical contest in the eighth grade, I have committed
        myself to training for mathematical olympiads with the ultimate goal of taking part in the International
        Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and scoring as highly as I can. Occasionally, I come across topics like projective
        geometry, where the ‘well-known’ lemmas memorised for olympiads make up only the tip of an iceberg’s worth of
        mathematical development I’d like to familiarise myself with.</p>
    <p>I realise that learning to solve olympiad problems pertaining to a prescribed syllabus as quickly and
        consistently as possible is not an end, but a means to improve mathematical intuition and awaken a passion in
        students like myself. Open-ended investigation intrigues me far more than learning to produce quickly the
        intended solution, so a degree in mathematics would support my curiosity to explore while also filling the gaps
        left by utilitarian training. I hope to give back to the olympiad community that first sparked my interest in
        mathematics by proposing original problems using the knowledge I gain from my studies.</p>

    <h1>How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?</h1>
    <p>The topics taught in a typical mathematics class at school are usually things I learned a year or two earlier, so
        I often find myself looking for something more exciting to do. Only at intensive mathematics programmes like
        olympiad training camps and summer schools do I feel a sense of accomplishment after lessons. The pace at these
        events is never sluggish like at school, and coaches liberally give hints and explanations for the endless
        supply of difficult problems. It is something about the exacting yet focused environment that allows me to
        immerse myself in learning a new concept or technique, and then be rewarded by the wave of ecstasy from solving
        a problem which had previously seemed hopeless.</p>
    <p>My most recent experience of this kind was at the Yau Mathcamp held in Shanghai this summer. This was my first
        introduction to higher mathematics, and my initial exposure to academic articles in mathematics. I liked how the
        camp followed a lecture-tutorial structure, with each problem sheet containing several tricky problems that
        forced me to ask for hints or work with a friend, unlike the straightforward school worksheets where every
        student is expected to solve everything. Moreover, presenting my solutions orally to the professor was both
        engaging and natural: for a proof to be sufficient, it need not be completely formal, as long as both parties
        share the intuition that formalisation is simple and purely mechanical.</p>
    <p>Attending this camp has not only developed my mathematical abilities, but also given me a glimpse of what further
        pursuing mathematics further feels like. To me, it is much more appealing than the narrow scope of olympiads
        which constitute most of my mathematical endeavours so far. Part of me hoped the camp would last a lot longer so
        that I would have the opportunity to be systematically introduced to many of the topics which were either
        skipped over or simply ‘believed’. A degree in mathematics would give me the challenge and excitement that
        school is lacking, and the academic foundations which few intensive programmes provide.</p>

    <h1>What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?</h1>
    <p>At Yau Mathcamp, my team of three earned the best project award by producing a novel albeit weak result in
        Diophantine approximation, a topic we were first introduced in the camp. My best achievements in olympiads
        include first prize in the Finnish high school contest in 2024 and 2025. Internationally, I earned a bronze
        medal at IMO 2024 in Bath and an honourable mention in RMM 2025. My success in the Finnish mathematics contest
        community is largely due to self-driven training, including solving IMO shortlist problems and working through
        textbooks like ‘Euclidean Geometry in Mathematical Olympiads’. These experiences show that I can learn quickly
        and independently, as mathematical studies often require.</p>
