<h1>Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others</h1>

<p>
Throughout primary and middle school, I studied percussion at a music school, but my relationship with music was almost entirely passive.
I never sought out music to listen to and practiced only when pushed by my parents, cramming before performances but rarely feeling proud of the result.
Occasionally my parents discussed returning the rented marimba, but I always begged to keep it, though never practicing enough to justify.
</p>

<p>
About two months into my first year of high school, a new classmate of mine invited me to a concert in Helsinki Music Centre featuring Grieg’s Piano Concerto.
I told him I was not very interested, but he insisted, asking how it was possible I avoided a performance of such an eminent piece.
Really, I have never even heard it, and had no convincing reason to decline, so I agreed to take part for once, solely for the sake of our friendship.
</p>

<p>
In the past, I had been to concerts at the Music Centre as a mandatory part of music school, but this was the first time I paid for my visit.
I was anxious that I would not be able to make any valuable comments after the performance, and I feared that the visit would be wasted if I failed to perceive all the details and intricacies of the music.
I doubted whether hearing the piece live could really provide me with something I could not get from a good recording.
</p>

<p>
These anxious thoughts vanished a few minutes into the first movement.
The central theme, sung with grandeur, swelled into a loud, dissonant climax before returning transformed, with the earlier vehemence replaced by the calm of a single flute set against the soloist’s quiet accompaniment.
At this moment I finally understood what was meant by the ‘romantic ideal’, this time as an experience and not just another definition taught in music school.
I faced a world of sound so beautiful and passionate that it enveloped my consciousness and overpowered any trivial worries I had.
At the end of the movement I was filled with a euphoric sense of joy, and realised that I was smiling and feeling very grateful for my friend and for all the musicians on stage for helping me discover this.
</p>

<p>
This concert answered my doubts about live music and made me realise that nothing more was required to benefit from it than sincere listening and openness to its mood.
In orchestra rehearsals I would now listen to others playing when I rest, while before I usually watched my phone instead.
At home I spent more time practicing, and I began work on Bach’s invention in A minor, which would become my first self-driven project.
My parents were gladly surprised to find out I could now practice independently, and they never mentioned stopping the rent again.
Instead of practicing out of necessity and sunken cost at the music school, I now practice for the joy of replicating and expressing the music in recordings or performances I find pleasant.
</p>

<p>
This event has shown me the importance of being able to take imperfect first steps instead of rejecting something without a genuine attempt.
I have applied the same principle in other parts of my life, like mathematical training, for example, where I no longer need to learn all the theory from textbooks before proceeding to past problems, which has made my development faster and more enjoyable.
Three years ago I still pursued music only out of sunken cost, while now I stay for the joy it brings me.
My past self might feel uncomfortable seeing my eschewal of perfectionism, but he would genuinely be happy to see my development as both a musician and a learner.
