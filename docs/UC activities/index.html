<h1>UC Activities and Awards</h1>

<a name="1"></a>
<h2>1. Bronze Medal, International Mathematical Olympiad 2024</h2>

<p><span class="label">Level of recognition:</span> International</p>
<p><span class="label">Type of award:</span> Academic</p>
<p><span class="label">Grade level when awarded:</span> 10th grade</p>

<p><span class="label">Award requirements:</span>
At IMO 2024, 326 medals were given, out which 145 were bronze. A bronze medal indicates placing above half the
participants, and I placed 252nd with 17 as a result of solving problems 1 and 5, and getting partial solutions for
problems 2 and 4.
</p>

<p><span class="label">What you did to earn award:</span>
I had started practicing specifically for the IMO on August 2023, after learning that I was selected for the Finnish team
for Baltic Way 2023 in Germany based on the TST. I prepared by working on Evan Chen's EGMO and Khurmi's MONT,
alongside actively attending national and Nordic training camps whenever possible.

<h2>2. Honorable Mention, Romanian Master of Mathematics 2025</h2>

<p><span class="label">Level of recognition:</span> International</p>
<p><span class="label">Type of award:</span> Academic</p>
<p><span class="label">Grade level when awarded:</span> 11th grade</p>

<p><span class="label">Award requirements:</span>
The strongest contestant from each Nordic country, based on a TST camp in December, is selected and together form
team Nordics to participate in the Romanian Master of Mathematics. Then, at the contest, an HM is awarded to
everyone with a full solve.
</p>

<p><span class="label">What you did to earn award:</span>
Getting selected to the RMM team means I scored the most out of Finnish candidates at the team selection test. At
RMM, I produced a perfect solution to the first problem. I had not practiced for just the RMM; the problems here are
different in character, and generally more difficult than the IMO which I prepared for almost daily since IMO 2024.

<h2>3. Gold Prize, 2025 Yau Mathcamp Best Project Award</h2>

<p><span class="label">Level of recognition:</span> National; International</p>
<p><span class="label">Type of award:</span> Academic</p>
<p><span class="label">Grade level when awarded:</span> 11th grade</p>

<p><span class="label">Award requirements:</span>
The gold prize is given to the top three Yau Mathcamp projects. Each project is by a team of three participants and
involves research under a Mathcamp professor and presenting the results. Professors choose the recipients based on
the presentation.
</p>

<p><span class="label">What you did to earn award:</span>
My project is in multidimensional diophantine approximation, which I was introduced to at the camp. My team worked
on it full-time for two weeks at the camp, and produced a novel result. Then we paid attention to make the presentation
not too involved, so that professors outside this specific field would still understand something.
</p>

<h2>4. 1st Place, MAOL National High School Math Contest 2024</h2>

<p><span class="label">Level of recognition:</span> National</p>
<p><span class="label">Type of award:</span> Academic</p>
<p><span class="label">Grade level when awarded:</span> 10th grade</p>

<p><span class="label">Award requirements:</span>
In 2024 (10th grade), I tied for first place with another contestant at the final round of the Finnish high school contest.
This means perfect solutions for every problem.
</p>

<p><span class="label">What you did to earn award:</span>
I needed to score well enough in the first round to qualify for the final round. Of course, my preparation for the IMO is
wholly applicable here.
</p>

<h2>5. 1st Place, MAOL National High School Math Contest 2025</h2>

<p><span class="label">Level of recognition:</span> National</p>
<p><span class="label">Type of award:</span> Academic</p>
<p><span class="label">Grade level when awarded:</span> 11th grade</p>

<p><span class="label">Award requirements:</span>
This year (2025, 11th grade) first place was not shared.
</p>

<p><span class="label">What you did to earn award:</span>
I needed to score well enough in the first round to qualify for the final round. Of course, my preparation for the IMO is
wholly applicable here.

<h2>6. Honorable Mention, International Mathematical Olympiad 2025</h2>

<p><span class="label">Level of recognition:</span> International</p>
<p><span class="label">Type of award:</span> Academic</p>
<p><span class="label">Grade level when awarded:</span> 11th grade</p>

<p><span class="label">Award requirements:</span>
My failure is due to time management issues during the contest: more problems were now of a 'doable' difficulty, so I
skipped around more and was less focused. I was one point away from Bronze, so I only received an HM thanks to
problem 1.
</p>

<p><span class="label">What you did to earn award:</span>
I had practiced so much between the previous IMO and this one. As preparation, I've done basically all of EGMO, and
the first few chapters of MONT. Moreover, I have solved about 100 IMO shortlist problems. Unfortunately, since I rarely
wrote the full solutions down in my practice, my writeups during the IMO took much longer than expected.

<h2>7. Finalist, Datatahti National Programming Contest 2025</h2>

<p><span class="label">Level of recognition:</span> National</p>
<p><span class="label">Type of award:</span> Academic</p>
<p><span class="label">Grade level when awarded:</span> 11th grade</p>

<p><span class="label">Award requirements:</span>
This year, the top 23 contestants of the opening round advance to the finals.
I received 18th place with 460 points in the opening round, and 14th place with 168 points in the finals.
The finals were IOI-style.
</p>

<p><span class="label">What you did to earn award:</span>
I started doing CSES intermittently in August 2023, and I didn't train competitive programming outside of that.
Closer to the first round I started training with Antti Laaksosen book and doing more problems from the Finnish
problem set. I also avoided using AI or external help, so I often spent hours on a single problem.
</p>

<h2>8. Finalist, Datatahti National Programming Contest 2026</h2>

<p><span class="label">Level of recognition:</span> National</p>
<p><span class="label">Type of award:</span> Academic</p>
<p><span class="label">Grade level when awarded:</span> 12th grade</p>

<p><span class="label">Award requirements:</span>
I placed 4th place in the first round; only 11 points from full points.
The first round had 14 days of submission time, but was otherwise a standard individual programming competition.
The final round is upcoming on 17 Jan.
</p>

<p><span class="label">What you did to earn award:</span>
I did not practice much between the 2025 Final Round and this contest.
But I have a total of 79 tasks solved in the Finnish problem set on CSES as of 12 Nov 2025.
I don't expect to place as high in the final round, but top 10 is definitely within reach.

<h2>9. Educational Preparation Program</h2>

<h2>Yau Mathcamp 2025</h2>

<p>
The camp consists of university math courses (Topology and Number Theory) taught to secondary school students,
and a collaborative research project guided by a professor of the subject. I learned the basics of topology and
dove into Diophantine approximation more deeply. In the exams I placed above more than half the participants.
</p>

<p><span class="label">Grade participation:</span> 11th grade</p>
<p><span class="label">Time commitment:</span> 168.0 hours per week, 4.0 weeks per year</p>

<hr>

<h2>10. Extracurricular Activity</h2>

<h2>Principal Timpani, Tapiola Youth Symphony Orchestra</h2>

<p>
I play the timpani at the symphony orchestra of my music school. We have four periods yearly, each with new
repertoire and culminating in performances. I've improved as a timpanist and gained recognition so that I am
occasionally invited to perform in various orchestras. Reported time includes practice outside orchestra rehearsal.
</p>

<p><span class="label">Grade participation:</span> 9th–12th grade</p>
<p><span class="label">Time commitment:</span> 5.0 hours per week, 20.0 weeks per year</p>

<hr>

<h2>11. Extracurricular Activity</h2>

<h2>Leader of Mathematics Club at My School</h2>

<p>
I led Mathematics Club with two classmates, teaching theory for math contests to underclassmen weekly.
We planned the topics and activities, and I was in charge of much of the teaching.
I learned the importance of planning and how just some notes written beforehand can keep a lecture together.
</p>

<p><span class="label">Grade participation:</span> 11th grade</p>
<p><span class="label">Time commitment:</span> 5.0 hours per week, 14.0 weeks per year</p>

<hr>

<h2>12. Extracurricular Activity</h2>

<h2>Percussion Studies, Espoo Music Institute</h2>

<p>
I take weekly percussion lessons at a music school, and I'm currently working on my graduation recital where
I plan to perform a combination of original and arranged repertoire on the marimba and the vibraphone.
Playing and listening to music is a great part of my life now, and I practice my instrument daily to relax from studying.
</p>

<p><span class="label">Grade participation:</span> 9th–12th grade</p>
<p><span class="label">Time commitment:</span> 10.0 hours per week, 35.0 weeks per year</p>
